The WeatherLinkParser is designed to take an outputted XML file from Davis Instruments' WeatherLink software and save it to a SQLite database. It also can upload the weather data as a JSON file to an FTP destination of choice. Additionally, it can accept and upload a JPEG image via FTP from a webcam.
